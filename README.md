### Overview
This project is a comprehensive exploration and processing of diverse datasets. It aims to apply various data science techniques, such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and model building, across different types of data including tabular, timeseries, spatio-temporal, image, audio, video, and graph datasets.

### Objectives
Conduct detailed EDA to understand the structure and characteristics of each dataset.
Apply preprocessing steps including data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
Implement machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

### Datasets
Multiple datasets are utilized in this project, each corresponding to different types of data such as tabular, timeseries, spatio-temporal, image, audio, video, and graph data. Each dataset brings its own set of challenges and learning opportunities.

### Methodology
## Exploration and Preprocessing: 
The project starts with an initial exploration of each dataset, identifying patterns, anomalies, and key characteristics. Necessary preprocessing steps such as data cleaning and transformation are applied.

## Model Building: 
Various machine learning models are built and evaluated based on their performance. Auto-ML tools may also be leveraged for model selection and tuning.
